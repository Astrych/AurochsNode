# Pinkcoin network scanner

General purpose tool implementing Pinkcoin node messaging protocol. Initial code based on: https://github.com/perone/protocoin

Work in progress: this is going to scan the network and compute nodes statitics, collect blockchian data, etc. In the future maybe I will use it to code simple implementation of Pinkcoin full node.

Things to do:

1. Secure messaging protocol implementation.
2. paralelisation of concurent connections.
3. Saving downloaded data in a database.
4. ...
